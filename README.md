### Project Conclusion: Heart Health Analysis

This project demonstrates the critical role of data analytics in the early detection and prevention of heart disease by identifying key clinical and lifestyle risk factors. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling using logistic regression, the study achieved high data reliability and strong predictive performance, enabling effective identification of individuals at elevated risk.The analysis revealed that factors such as age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and exercise-induced angina are significant indicators of cardiovascular disease. The logistic regression model further proved to be a reliable tool for early risk detection, supporting proactive clinical decision-making and timely intervention.By transforming complex clinical data into actionable insights, this project highlights the value of data-driven approaches in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, supporting preventive healthcare strategies, and improving patient outcomes. Overall, the findings underscore the potential of predictive analytics to reduce heart disease incidence and contribute to improved public health outcomes through informed, timely medical care.
